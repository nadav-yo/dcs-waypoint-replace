This is a simple script to rewrite DCS missions:
Copy all waypoints of blue coalition country 1 plane groups to be identical to group 1. 
It gets one input - a file path to the original mission.
It will open, read mission file, modify and repack.

In order to write mission I wrote a custom very basic LuaWriter.
