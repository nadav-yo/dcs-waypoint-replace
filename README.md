# Waypoint Replace for DCS Missions

## Overview

This application is designed to query and modify Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) missions, and then repack it.
Right now, it can get and copy routes, and get group details. 
Ideas are more than welcome!

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following:

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** The script is written in Java, and you need a JRE installed on your system.

## Running the Script

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
java -jar waypoint-replace-0.0.12.jar
```
<b> Note! <br/>
* Replace 0.0.12 with the actual version downloaded
</b>


## Custom LuaWriter
The script utilizes a custom and very basic LuaWriter to write the modified mission file.
